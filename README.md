# School_District_Analysis

# Overview 
The school board has suspected academic dishonesty from 9th graders at Thomas High School. To uphold school testing standards we must go in and remove the math and reading scores for Thomas High School 9th graders while keeping the rest of the data intact. Then perform a new round of anlalysis where we account for the removal of those grades and how it affects:

- The district summary
- The school summary
- The top 5 and bottom 5 performing schools, based on the overall passing rate
- The average math score for each grade level from each school
- The average rading score for each grade level from each school
- The scores by school spending per student, by school size, and by shcool type 

# Results
